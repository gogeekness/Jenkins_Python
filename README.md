# Jenkins_Python
A repository to test, use, and store Python code to create Windows (Linux?) binaries with Jenkins.

The goal is to run some of my old Python code as self-contained applications in Windows.
This will help understand the CI/CD aspect of the software design.  I hope this will improve my 
 knowledge of DevOps and using tools to create active programs.
